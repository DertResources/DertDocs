												<h1> Using a Template </h1>
												<p>
																To get started making a project of your own design it is easiest
																to get started from a template. Starting a new project on your
																own from scratch involves a lot of configuring build directories,
																adjusting settings, and getting started in simulink with game state
																setup. These templates will also make it easy for teaching new students,
																as is currently going on in DERT’s programming lessons.
												</p>
												<p>
																To use the most recent template go to this <a href="https://github.com/DertResources/DertTemplateProject">link</a>,
																the default branch is stable so do not worry about getting a in development version.
												</p>
												<p>
																Before starting this process, I’ll say that if you feel generous, please leave a
																star so I can see how many people have actually used the template as github does
																not currently have a way I can see if people are making new projects versus just
																visiting the site and giving up.

												<p>
																On the next page leave the checkmark for “Include all branches” unchecked.
																Fill in your repository name and make sure the owner is correct 
																(weather it be you or your organization) along with picking your privacy setting
																Click “Create repository”
																In your new Repo, the only branch will be named “stable.” To fix this we can rename the branch
